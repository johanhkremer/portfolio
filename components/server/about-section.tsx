                            I&apos;ve loved technology and IT for as long as I can remember. In high school, I was passionate about film studies and web development, and after graduation, I built my first desktop computer. Initially intimidated by the idea of an IT career, I chose teaching humanities and social sciences instead. After ten years in education, including starting a 3D printing course, I realized teaching wasn&apos;t enoughâ€”I needed to follow my passion.

                            Today, I&apos;m a junior front-end developer, creating user-friendly web applications with TypeScript, React, and Next.js. I also have backend experience with authentication, databases, and APIs, and a strong interest in UX design using Figma.

                            What I enjoy most is continuous learning, discovering new technologies, and collaborating with others to solve challenges.
